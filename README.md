# cervical_cancer_cnn

This repo contains the work done by Stephen Pfohl, Ben Marafino and Oskar Triebe for the Stanford CS231N class project. 
The problem solved is the classification of images with limited training data. The code can serve as example for the following subdomains within Deep Learning:

* Transfer Learning
* Data Transformations and Training Pipelines
* Model Ensembles

Additional to the code submitted to the Kaggle Challenge "ODT/Intel Cervical Cancer", the poster and paper presenting the work done are included.
Further material, such as experiments with different augmentations or other models (SqueezeNet, Inception) are not included, but can be distributed upon request.

Our motivation to publish this is to help other researchers kickstart their projects. Also, we want to support the young PyTorch community by publishing our code. Please feel free to use under appropriate attribution.
